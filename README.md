## LearnOpenGL
This repository is to store exercises from the LearnOpenGL book along with any other small projects I build with OpenGL.

### Building
Currently set up for building through the command line.

From the root directory do the following:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
The resulting binaries will be outputted in `LearnOpenGL/bin`
